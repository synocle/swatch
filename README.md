# swatch
Searches Google for `Hours since [currentDateTime]` -- thus, it is a stopwatch.

You may replace `Hours` with `Time`, `Seconds`, `Minutes`, `Days` et cetera.

Place it in C:\Windows and then you can run the command "swatch" in your terminal.

It will open your default browser to a Google search, showing the time elapsed since you launched command.

You can then bookmark the page if you like.
